            "I'm a big fan of cinnamon rolls myself, so here's a delicious recipe for making them at home. These cinnamon rolls are simple to make and can be used as a bread or you can also roll them into sweet treats like icing balls. For the dough, mix flour, sugar, cinnamon, salt, and yeast in a large bowl until well blended. Add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes. Knead the dough by hand until it comes together like a dough ball. Form into a ball and place on a greased baking sheet. Roll out to 1/4-inch thickness and let rest at room temperature while you prepare the filling. For the filling, beat butter, eggs, vanilla, and confectioners sugar in a medium sized mixing bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Pour this mixture over the dough and form it into a loaf. Place in a greased 9x5-inch loaf pan. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 30 minutes, or until golden brown and puffed up. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes before slicing. Serve warm.\n",
