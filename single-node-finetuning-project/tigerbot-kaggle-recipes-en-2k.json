Mix on medium speed until the dough comes together in a ball and begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl, about 5 minutes.\n1: Use wet hands to wipe the dough from the hook and cover the bowl with a kitchen towel. Place the dough in a warm place and let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.\n2: Line a 9 x 13-inch baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly grease with nonstick spray.\n3: Uncover the bowl and transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet. Use your hands to gently press the dough to the edges of the pan. Refrigerate until the dough is completely chilled all the way through, at least 1 hour, or up to 8 hours. If refrigerating for more than 1 hour, cover with plastic wrap to prevent the dough from drying out.\n4: Make the butter block: Cut a sheet of parchment paper to measure 12 x 16 inches. Fold the edges inward to create a 7-inch square, then unfold the parchment.\n5: Slice the butter lengthwise into \u00bc-inch-thick pieces and arrange the butter tiles in a single layer to fill the center 7-inch square of the parchment. Fold the parchment over to fully enclose the butter and let the packet sit at room temperature until slightly softened, about 30 minutes. When the butter is malleable, use a rolling pin to distribute the butter in an even layer to the edges and corners of the packet. If the butter is too soft, refrigerate the packet until it firms up, about 20 minutes.  You want the butter and the dough to have the same texture.\n6: Laminate the dough: Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a very lightly floured work surface (too much flour will break the lamination, so use just enough to keep the dough from sticking to the work surface). Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a rectangle that is a little more than twice as long as the butter block, about 8 x 15 inches.  Place the butter block in the center of the dough and fold the sides of the dough over the butter to completely encase the block, gently pressing the dough together to seal.\n7: Very lightly dust the rolling pin with flour and roll the dough into a square, about \u00bc inch thick.  Use a pastry wheel or long, sharp knife to trim the edges so the butter is just barely exposed on all sides (trimming the edges will help make clean and even layers when folding the dough). Fold the dough in half horizontally, then fold in half vertically, making sure to line up the edges. Place the dough square back on the baking sheet and let the dough rest in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.\n8: Remove the dough from the refrigerator and repeat rolling out to \u00bc-inch-thick square, trimming the edges, and folding one more time. Return the dough to the baking sheet and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Place the dough in the refrigerator and let rest overnight.\n9: Shape the donuts: Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.\n10: Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let sit at room temperature until it is soft enough to roll without applying too much pressure, about 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to a very lightly floured surface and roll into a 14-inch square. Let the dough rest for about 5 minutes to let the gluten relax.\n11: Using a 3\u00bd-inch round cutter, cut out 12 rounds from the dough. Use a 1-inch round cutter to cut out the center of each dough round. Place the donuts on the prepared baking sheet, spacing about 2 inches apart. Lightly grease a piece of plastic wrap with nonstick spray and gently cover the pan. Let the donuts proof at room temperature until doubled in size, about 2 hours.\n12: Fry the donuts: Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot fitted with a deep fry thermometer over medium-high heat until the temperature reaches 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Set a wire rack over a baking sheet.\n13: Working in batches of 3\u20134 at a time, fry the donuts in the hot oil, flipping once halfway through, until golden brown all over, about 3 minutes. Use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer the donuts to the wire rack to cool slightly, about 10 minutes.\n14: Make the icing: In a medium bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, vanilla bean seeds, and buttermilk until smooth. Transfer the icing to a small piping bag and cut a hole in the tip.\n15: Pipe the icing on the top of the donuts.\n16: Enjoy!"}

{"instruction": "Give the cooking plan according to the name of the dish entered.", "input": "fresh-pasta-dough", "output": "ingredients:all-purpose flour (2cups)\u3001kosher salt (1pinch)\u3001large eggs\u3001large egg yolks\u3001extra virgin olive oil (1tablespoon)\ninstructions:\n0: On a clean, sturdy work surface, turn out your chosen flour(s) and salt and make a large well in the middle with your hands.\n1: Whisk the eggs, egg yolks, and olive oil together in a medium bowl until combined, then pour the mixture into the well.\n2: Using the same fork, whisk the eggs, slowly incorporating more and more flour into the eggs by moving your fork along the edges of the well.\n3: Once almost all of the flour is incorporated, start bringing the dough together with your hands. (The dough should be malleable, but not sticky--add more flour if the dough is sticking too much to your hands or the surface. Alternatively, if it\u2019s too dry and tough, whisk another egg with 1 tablespoon of water and use your hand to sprinkle some of the mixture over the dough, continuing to do so until the dough is easier to knead.)\n4: Knead the dough for 7-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. When you poke the dough, it should spring back.\n5: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes to an hour, or until the dough does not spring back when poked.\n6: Unwrap the dough and cut into 8 equal pieces so that it\u2019s easier to work with. Take 1 piece and wrap the rest in the plastic wrap so that they don\u2019t dry out.\n7: Lightly flour your work surface, and begin rolling out the piece of dough into one long piece. Then, fold the top third down, and the bottom third over that, like a letter. Rotate the dough 90\u02da and roll the piece back into a long shape. This helps form a more even rectangular shape and makes the dough a little bit easier to work with.\n8: Continue rolling out the dough until it is very thin. When you lift the dough, you should be able to see your hands through it.\n9: Fold the top and bottom of the rectangle to meet in the middle, then fold over again--this will make the dough easier to cut. Cut the dough to your ideal shape. Loosen or unravel the cut dough immediately, so it doesn\u2019t stick, sprinkle with a bit of extra flour, or semolina, if using. Let the pasta sit out for about 30 minutes to dry out slightly.\n10: Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and stir to ensure it doesn\u2019t clump. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or 30 seconds to 1 minute after the pasta comes to the surface (fresh pasta will cook much faster than dried pasta!)\n11: Take out a noodle and taste for doneness. Once cooked to your liking, remove the pasta from the water, being sure to save at least 1 cup (240 ML) of the pasta cooking water.\n12: Add the cooked pasta into your preferred sauce and stir to coat, adding some of the reserved pasta water if needed to add a bit of body and silkiness to the sauce.\n13: Enjoy!"}

Place the wrapped turkey on a baking sheet and set on the bottom shelf of the fridge. Defrost for 1 day if fresh, or 4-5 days, if frozen. For a quicker defrost, submerge the turkey in a large sink or cooler filled with cold water and defrost for 30 minutes per pound of turkey.\n1: 1 day before cooking, brine the turkey. Measure the salt into a small bowl. Set up your work station with kitchen shears, a plastic bag, a fresh baking sheet with a wire rack set over it, and a garbage can nearby.\n2: Cut the packaging off the defrosted turkey, being careful not to cut the skin or flesh, and remove from the bag. Set the turkey on the baking sheet with the wire rack. Cut off any excess skin around the neck and release the plastic holder securing the legs. Remove any innards and giblets from the cavity and discard. Thoroughly pat the turkey dry with paper towels.\n3: Sprinkle the salt all over the turkey, making sure to get in the cavity, under the skin, and between any crevices.\n4: Refrigerate the turkey, uncovered, for 1 day. If brining for more than 1 day, cover the turkey with plastic wrap, then remove for the last day to let the skin dry out before roasting.\n5: A few hours before serving, prepare the turkey for roasting. Set an oven rack at the lowest height and the other in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 325\u02daF (160\u02daC).\n6: Add the butter to a medium bowl. Chop the sage leaves and add to the bowl, along with the garlic, thyme, and rosemary. Mash the herbs into the butter. Set aside.\n7: Set a roasting pan or single-use aluminum pan over a baking sheet near your work station.\n8: Trim off the wing tips of the turkey and add to the roasting pan. Cut off any excess skin to expose the wishbone, then use a paring knife to cut out the bone. Use your hands or kitchen shears if the bone is hard to remove. Add to the roasting pan.\n9: Turn the bird so the legs are facing you. Tug out the plastic holder. Loosen the skin around the breasts, using your fingers to create a pocket. Be careful not to tear the skin. Rub the herb butter under the skin, then all over the rest of the turkey. Make sure to get in any crevices and the cavity.\n10: Stuff the lemon wedges and \u00bc of the onion inside the turkey cavity. Add the rest of the onion wedges to the roasting pan, along with the carrot and celery. Pour the chicken broth into the pan.\n11: Use the wire rack to rest the turkey over the roasting pan, then pour any accumulated juices from the baking sheet into the pan.\n12: Set the roasting pan on the lowest oven rack. Place the turkey on the wire rack on the middle oven rack, directly over the roasting pan to catch any juices.\n13: Roast the turkey for about 2 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 160\u02daF (71\u02daC). Start checking the turkey about 90 minutes into roasting to ensure it does not overcook.\n14: Remove the turkey from the oven and set the wire rack over a baking sheet to catch any juices. Let rest for about 30 minutes while the internal temperature climbs to 165\u02daF (74\u02daC).\n15: Meanwhile, make the gravy: Remove any solids from the roasting pan. Strain the liquid into a large pot and bring to a boil, then let reduce to your desired consistency. The gravy can be served as is or, for a thicker gravy, ladle a few spoonfuls of stock into a small bowl with the flour. Whisk until no lumps remain, then stir a bit of the flour mixture at a time back into the pot. Return to a boil and let cook for 5 minutes, until thickened. Repeat as needed until the gravy has reached your desired consistency. Reduce the heat to low, whisking occasionally, until ready to serve, or remove from the heat and bring back to temperature before serving.\n16: Carve the turkey: Transfer the turkey to a large cutting board with a lip to catch any juices. First, release the legs to make carving the rest of the bird easier. Using a sharp knife, cut along where the legs meets the breasts, being careful not to cut all the way through. Then, use your hands to pull the legs and thigh away from the carcass and tuck them under the wings to keep them in place.\n17: Cut straight down along both sides of the breast bone until you can\u2019t cut any further, then cut horizontally near the wing to release the breasts from the carcass.\n18: Cut all the way through the legs to release from the hip joint.\n19: Find where the shoulder meets the breast, then cut through that joint to remove the wings, using your hands to pull the wing away if the joint is tough to find.\n20: Set the carcass aside--you can pick off any remaining meat for leftovers, or make stock from the whole carcass.\n21: Slice the breasts crosswise, against the grain, then transfer to a serving platter. Cut the drumsticks from the thighs through the joint, wiggling the knife to find an easy release or pulling apart with your hands. Add the drumsticks to the platter. Cut the thigh meat away from the bone, then into bite-size pieces, and add to the platter. Release the flats from the wings by cutting through the joint, pulling apart with your hands if necessary, then add to the platter.\n22: Rearrange the meat on the platter so the larger pieces of meat with crispy, browned skin are on top. Garnish the platter with sage leaves and lemon wedges, if desired.\n23: Serve with the warm gravy.\n24: Enjoy!"}

It should feel heavy and dense. If the watermelon feels light and hollow, it has lost too much of its natural moisture.\n1: Brine and smoke the watermelon: Carefully cut the ends off of the watermelon. Turn the watermelon onto a flat side, then cut off the rind, working carefully to cut off as little flesh as possible. Discard the rind. The watermelon should look like a football with flat ends and be red all over, with no remaining white patches.\n2: Lay the watermelon on the cutting board lengthwise. Find the side of the watermelon that has the largest surface area and set that face-up. If the watermelon will not lay steadily with that side up, slice a small amount off the back to make a flat surface, which will allow the watermelon to sit evenly.\n3: On the top of the watermelon, cut 1-inch deep diagonal slits in opposite directions to form a cross-hatch pattern.\n4: In a medium bowl, whisk together the salt, coconut sugar, chili powder, paprika, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cloves.\n5: Rub the spice mixture all over the watermelon, making sure to get some between the cross-hatch cuts, but being careful not to tear the watermelon.\n6: Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet. Place the watermelon on the rack, cross-hatch side up, and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 12 hours. This will pull out excess moisture and allow the flavors from the spice rub to permeate the entire watermelon.\n7: Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F (230\u00b0C).\n8: Drain all but 2 tablespoons of the hickory chip soaking liquid, then spread the chips and reserved liquid in an even layer over the bottom of a roasting pan. Set a roasting rack on top.\n9: Place the watermelon, cross-hatch side up on the roasting rack. Cover the pan tightly with heavy-duty foil.\n10: Bake the watermelon for 30 minutes. You will begin to see a bit of smoke coming from the roasting pan. If it is smoking too much, you may need to carefully tighten the foil around your pan to keep the smoke inside.\n11: Reduce the oven temperature to 250\u00b0F (120\u00b0C). Continue baking the watermelon for 3 hours, then remove the foil and roast another 3 hours.\n12: While the watermelon roasts, make the chipotle and honey glaze: Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring frequently, for 1-2 minutes, or until light golden brown in color and very fragrant.\n13: Add the coconut sugar, honey, orange juice, mustard, chipotle, salt, and Worcestershire sauce and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture is evenly combined.

Repeat with the remaining dough, rolling out slightly thinner to \u00bc inch thick. Roll the thicker dough round onto the rolling pin and transfer to a 9-inch (22 cm) glass deep dish pie plate, gently lifting and pressing so the dough is flush against the dish. Brush the inside of the dough with the egg wash, including the sides and outer rim. Add the chilled filling, spreading evenly.\n17: Drape the remaining dough round over the pie. Trim any excess dough around the edges, then pinch the top and bottom doughs together to seal. Roll the edges under, all the way around the pie dish, and crimp using the knuckle of an index finger of one hand and the thumb and index finger of the other.\n18: Brush the egg wash all over the top of the dough, getting in the grooves and sides of the pie. Use a paring knife to cut a few vents in the top to allow the steam to escape. Sprinkle flaky sea salt on top.

Spread the mushrooms on a baking sheet in an even layer and transfer to the oven. Cook, stirring every 15 minutes, until the mushrooms have released their moisture and are dried out, about 45 minutes total.\n2: Meanwhile, truss the tenderloin: Measure a piece of butcher\u2019s twine 6 times the length of the tenderloin. Wrap the twine around one end of the loin and tie a knot to secure the string. Make a loop around your hand with the string and place over the loin about 1 inch down from the first knot. Continue looping the twine in 1-inch intervals until you reach the end, then tie the twine in a knot to secure (this helps the tenderloin hold its shape). Generously season the beef tenderloin with salt and black pepper.\n3: Heat the vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Place the seasoned tenderloin in the pan and sear quickly on all sides to lock in moisture, about 1 minute per side. Do not overcook; it\u2019s fine if the meat does not have a golden brown crust.\n4: Remove the pan from the heat and transfer the seared tenderloin to a small plate or baking sheet. Cut off the twine, then brush the tenderloin with the mustard to cover completely. Transfer to the refrigerator to cool, about 1 hour.\n5: Return the pan to medium-low heat. Add the butter, shallots, and garlic and cook until the shallots have caramelized, about 5 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon or heat-safe spatula to prevent from burning.\n6: Deglaze the pan with the cognac, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom. Continue cooking until the alcohol has evaporated and the pan is mostly dry, about 1 minute. Add the dehydrated mushrooms and stir to incorporate. Season with salt to taste. Transfer the duxelles to a bowl and cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly against the surface. Transfer to the refrigerator to cool completely, about 45 minutes.\n7: On a large sheet of plastic wrap, arrange the prosciutto in a large rectangle wide enough to cover the tenderloin, layering evenly. Spread the mushroom mixture evenly across the prosciutto, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges, and press down in a flat layer.\n8: Place the tenderloin at the bottom of the mushroom mixture and use the plastic wrap to help roll the prosciutto and mushrooms around the tenderloin. The prosciutto should tightly and completely cover the tenderloin. Hold the ends of the plastic wrap and roll the log to help create a tight seal. Refrigerate the roll until chilled all the way through, about 1 hour.\n9: Place a sheet of puff pastry on a lightly floured surface and roll out with a lightly floured rolling pin until the pastry sheet is large enough to cover the log.\n10: Brush the top third of the puff pastry with beaten egg. Unwrap the log and place on the bottom third of the pastry, then roll up into a tight log, turning so the seal is at the bottom. Fold in the sides of the pastry and press under the log. Set the log on a large sheet of plastic wrap and roll to wrap tightly. Refrigerate again while the oven preheats.\n11: Preheat the oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.\n12: Unwrap the log and set on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the log all over with beaten egg, then use a paring knife to create a decorative pattern on the puff pastry. Alternatively, cut the second sheet of puff pastry into long strips and create a lattice over the Wellington, and/or cut out autumnal shapes and press them onto the log. Brush the log with more beaten egg.\n13: Bake the Wellington until the puff pastry is a deep golden brown, 30\u201340 minutes. If the pastry is getting too dark before the beef is finished cooking, cover loosely with foil and continue cooking. The internal temperature of the beef should reach 125\u00b0F (52\u00b0C) for a medium-rare finish.\n14: Remove the Wellington from the oven and let rest for 1 hour. The internal temperature will continue to rise to 135\u00b0F (57\u00b0C).\n15: Slice the beef Wellington into 1-inch pieces and serve.\n16: Enjoy!"}

This turkey and pot required 4 \u00bd gallons (17 liter) of peanut oil, you may need more or less.\n2: To determine the correct amount, place the turkey in the pot you will be using to fry. Fill it with water until it has just covered your turkey, that water level should also be at least 5 inches (13 cm) below the rim of your pot. Remove the turkey and see where the water levels off, this is the amount of oil you will need to fry the turkey. If the oil level is NOT 5 inches (13 cm) below the rim of your pot, use a taller pot. If too much oil is used, it will spill over when the turkey is lowered and cause a fire. If you like, as a precaution, turn off the propane burner before you add the turkey to the hot oil.\n3: In a large pot, container or cooler with a lid, combine salt, brown sugar and boiling water to make the brine.\n4: Once the salt and brown sugar have dissolved, cool down with ice.\n5: Place your turkey into the brine mixture, add more cold water to cover your turkey entirely. Weight down the turkey with something heavy and cover.\n6: Place the turkey in a cool place or refrigerator and let it brine for 8-16 hours.\n7: Remove the turkey from the brine, discard the brine. Pat dry the turkey. Make sure it\u2019s entirely dry inside and out, border on very dry.\n8: Let it sit at room temp for 30 minutes prior to frying.\n9: While the turkey is coming to room temp, prepare your deep frying pot. The pot should be large enough to hold the turkey, oil and have enough room to contain the oil once it starts bubbling (recommend 30 quart/ 28-liter pot).\n10: NOTE: Make sure the deep frying pot is clean and dry, any moisture in the pot will make the oil pop when it starts heating up.\n11: Pour the peanut oil into the pot. You should have enough oil to just cover the turkey. Set over high heat on an outside propane burner. Bring the temperature of the oil to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).\n12: While the oil is heating up, prepare your turkey to submerge into the oil.\n13: If you are using a turkey deep frying kit, use all the equipment provided (i.e. hook/basket, s-hook, retrieval handle). If not, take a stainless steel kitchen utensil with a wide bottom, long handle and looped top. Take the kitchen utensil and push the handle through the neck of the turkey. You want the wide part of the utensil to rest inside the turkey cavity. Take an s-hook with a handle attachment and loop it through the loop part of the kitchen utensil.\n14: Wipe down the turkey again to make sure there is no moisture. Turkey is ready.\n15: Once the temperature of the oil has reached 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C), slowly and gently lower the turkey into the oil. SLOWLY AND GENTLY.\n16: Fry the turkey for 3 minutes per pound (455 grams). For a 15 lb (6.8 kg) turkey, this will take 45 minutes. Make sure the oil temp is maintained at 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C).\n17: After 45 minutes, turn off your propane burner and then gently remove the turkey from the oil.\n18: Place the turkey on a large baking sheet or carving board and check the temperature. Right out of the fryer, the breast meat should be at 150\u00b0F (65\u00b0C) and will reach 160\u00b0F (70\u00b0C) due to carry over cooking.\n19: Let the turkey rest for 30 minutes before carving.\n20: NOTE: Oil will be hot for a few hours after frying. Do not touch or dispose of until fully cooled.\n21: Carve as desired.\n22: Nutrition  Calories: 16381 Fat: 1761 grams  Carbs: 55 grams Fiber: 0 grams  Sugars: 54 grams  Protein: 137 grams\n23: Enjoy!"}

Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the chicken is cooked through and tender and the sauce has reduced and thickened, about 30 minutes.\n3: Remove the skillet from the oven, scatter the cubed avocados evenly around the chicken in the sauce, and let the chicken rest in the sauce for 10 minutes.\n4: Sprinkle with the cilantro and serve with tortillas on the side, if desired.\n5: Enjoy!"}
{"instruction": "Give the cooking plan according to the name of the dish entered.", "input": "squid-ink-fettuccine-with-black-mussels", "output": "ingredients:all purpose flour (2cups)\u3001kosher salt (1pinch)\u3001large eggs\u3001large egg yolks\u3001extra virgin olive oil (1tablespoon)\u3001squid ink (2teaspoons)\ninstructions:\n0: Make the pasta: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt, then turn out onto a clean surface and make a large well in the center.\n1: Add the eggs, egg yolks, olive oil, and squid ink to the well and mix with a fork until combined, slowly incorporating more and more flour into the mixture by moving the fork along the edges of the well. Once almost all of the flour is incorporated, start bringing the dough together with your hands. (The dough should be malleable, but not sticky--add more flour if the dough is sticking too much to your hands or the surface. Alternatively, if it\u2019s too dry and tough, whisk another egg with 1 tablespoon of water and use your hand to sprinkle a bit of the mixture over the dough, continuing to do so until the dough is easier to knead.)\n2: Knead the dough for 7\u201310 minutes, until smooth and elastic. When you poke the dough, it should spring back. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30\u201360 minutes, or until it does not spring back when poked.\n3: On a lightly floured surface, divide into 4 equal portions. Using a pasta roller, laminate and roll out 1 portion of the dough to setting #6. Repeat with the remaining dough.\n4: Dust the dough sheets with flour and fold each sheet onto itself 4\u20135 times. With a sharp knife, cut a dough sheet into \u00bc-inch (6 mm) strips. Unravel and place onto a floured baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough sheets.\n5: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta in the boiling water until al dente, about 4 minutes. Reserve \u00bc cup (60 ml) of the cooking water, then drain the pasta and set aside.\n6: Cook the mussels: Melt the olive oil and butter together in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, shallot and salt and cook until the garlic is fragrant and the shallot is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the wine and olives and cook until the wine is reduced by half, about 5 minutes more. Add the mussels, cover the pot with a lid, and cook until the mussels have opened fully, about 6\u20138 minutes. Discard any mussels that do not open. Remove the pot from the heat.\n7: Add the cooked pasta to the pot with the mussels and stir until the pasta is coated in the wine reduction. Add the reserved pasta water a bit at a time until a silky sauce is created.\n8: Divide the pasta and mussels between 4 plates, garnish with the parsley, and serve warm.\n9: Enjoy!"}
