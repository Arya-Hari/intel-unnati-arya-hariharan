# Official Repository for Arya Hariharan's Intel Unnati Industrial Training Program Submission

This project contains 3 folders.
* The first folder contains notebooks run from the build_chatbot_on_spr notebook of IDC and contains all the different chatbot versions with 1 to 3 tested inputs and outputs present in the notebooks itself.
* The next folder contains one of the recommended fine tuning notebooks from the single_node_finetuning_on_spr notebooj on IDC. The model in the .ipynb file was finetuned on the Alpaca dataset, but had to be prematurely halted in the fine-tuning process due to time and compute restraints. The model used was the Tiny Llama Chat.
* The last folder contains a project file that demonstrates the finetuning on the Tiny Llama Chat model on a (recipes dataset)[https://huggingface.co/datasets/TigerResearch/tigerbot-kaggle-recipes-en-2k] obtained from HuggingFace Hub. The output and Streamlit inference files have also been uploaded on the same.

The report is for the final project - Finetuning Tiny Llama on a Recipe Dataset using LoRA.
